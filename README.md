🚀 QC Ultra - KIWI Loader

QC Ultra - KIWI is an extension loader designed to make using Original QC Ultra easier, especially for new users or those who prefer an English-friendly interface.
This is not a standalone injector or replacement for QC Ultra — it works alongside the original QC Ultra installation to simplify setup, script management, and daily use.

🌟 Overview

The KIWI Loader focuses on accessibility and convenience while keeping all essential QC Ultra functionality in one place.
It’s designed for users who want a clean, beginner-friendly interface without losing advanced control options.
While the visuals have a light anime-inspired style, the goal is full practicality and smooth performance.
